# OxiDD

These are the Python bindings for OxiDD, a highly modular decision diagram framework written in Rust. The most prominent instance of decision diagrams is provided by [(reduced ordered) binary decision diagrams (BDDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram), which are succinct representations of Boolean functions 𝔹<sup>n</sup> → 𝔹. Such BDD representations are canonical and thus, deciding equality of Boolean functions—in general a co-NP-complete problem—can be done in constant time. Further, many Boolean operations on two BDDs *f,g* are possible in 𝒪(|*f*| · |*g*|) (where |*f*| denotes the node count in *f*). There are various other kinds of decision diagrams for which OxiDD aims to be a framework enabling high-performance implementations with low effort.


## Features

- **Several kinds of (reduced ordered) decision diagrams** are already implemented:
    - Binary decision diagrams (BDDs)
    - BDDs with complement edges (BCDDs)
    - Zero-suppressed BDDs (ZBDDs, aka ZDDs/ZSDDs)
    - Not yet exposed via the Python API: Multi-terminal BDDs (MTBDDs, aka ADDs) and Ternary decision diagrams (TDDs)
- **Extensibility**: Due to OxiDD’s modular design, one can implement new kinds of decision diagrams without having to reimplement core data structures.
- **Concurrency**: Functions represented by DDs can safely be used in multi-threaded contexts. Furthermore, apply algorithms can be executed on multiple CPU cores in parallel.
- **Performance**: Compared to other popular BDD libraries (e.g., BuDDy, CUDD, and Sylvan), OxiDD is already competitive or even outperforms them.
- **Support for Reordering**: OxiDD can reorder a decision diagram to a given variable order. Support for dynamic reordering, e.g., via sifting, is about to come.
