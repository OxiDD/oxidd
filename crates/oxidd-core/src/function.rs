/// Function in a decision diagram
///
/// A function is some kind of external reference to a node as opposed to
/// [`Edge`][crate::Edge]s, which are diagram internal. A function also includes
/// a reference to the diagram's manager. So one may view a function as an
/// [`Edge`][crate::Edge] plus a [`ManagerRef`].
///
/// Functions are what the library's user mostly works with. There may be
/// subtraits such as `BooleanFunction` in the `oxidd-rules-bdd` crate which
/// provide more functionality, in this case applying connectives of boolean
/// logic to other functions.
///
/// For some methods of this trait, there are notes on locking behavior. In a
/// concurrent setting, a manager has some kind of read/write lock, and
/// [`Self::with_manager_shared()`] / [`Self::with_manager_exclusive()`] acquire
/// this lock accordingly. In a sequential implementation, a
/// [`RefCell`][std::cell::RefCell] or the like may be used instead of lock.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// An implementation must ensure that the "[`Edge`][crate::Edge] part" of the
/// function points to a node that is stored in the manager referenced  by the
/// "[`ManagerRef`] part" of the function. All functions of this trait must
/// maintain this link accordingly. In particular, [`Self::as_edge()`] and
/// [`Self::into_edge()`] must panic as specified there.
pub unsafe trait Function: Clone + Ord + Hash {
    /// Type of the associated manager
    ///
    /// This type is generic over a lifetime `'id` to permit the "lifetime
    /// trick" used e.g. in [`GhostCell`][GhostCell]: The idea is to make the
    /// [`Manager`], [`Edge`][crate::Edge] and [`InnerNode`] types
    /// [invariant][variance] over `'id`. Any call to one of the
    /// [`with_manager_shared()`][Function::with_manager_shared] /
    /// [`with_manager_exclusive()`][Function::with_manager_exclusive] functions
    /// of the [`Function`] or [`ManagerRef`] trait, which "generate" a fresh
    /// lifetime `'id`. Now the type system ensures that every edge or node with
    /// `'id` comes belongs to the manager from the `with_manager_*()` call.
    /// This means that we can reduce the amount of runtime checks needed to
    /// uphold the invariant that the children of a node stored in [`Manager`] M
    /// are stored in M as well.
    ///
    /// Note that [`Function`] and [`ManagerRef`] are (typically) outside the
    /// scope of this lifetime trick to make the library more flexible.
