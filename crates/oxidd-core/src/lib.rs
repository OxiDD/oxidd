//! Collection of fundamental traits and types to represent decision diagrams
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! One of the most central traits is [`Manager`]. The manager is responsible
//! for storing the nodes of a decision diagram ([`InnerNode`]s and terminal
//! nodes) and provides [`Edge`]s to identify them.
//!
//! From the user's perspective, [`Function`][function::Function] is very
//! important. A function is some kind of external reference to a node and is
//! the basis for assigning semantics to nodes and providing operations such as
//! applying connectives of boolean logic.

/// Manager for nodes in a decision diagram
///
/// In the basic formulation, a decision diagram is a directed acyclic graph
/// where all inner nodes are associated with a level, and each level in turn is
/// associated with a variable. A decision diagram can represent functions
/// Dⁿ → T, where n is the number of variables. Every inner node has |D|
/// outgoing edges, pointing to child nodes. The semantics of an inner node
/// depends on the value of its associated variable. If the variable has
/// value d ∈ D, then the node's semantics is the semantics of the child
/// referenced by the edge corresponding to d. Every terminal node is associated
/// with a value t ∈ T, and the node's semantics is just that value t. Some
/// kinds of decision diagrams deviate from this formulation in one way or the
/// other, but still fit into the framework.
///
/// The manager's responsibility is to store nodes and provide edges to identify
/// them. Internally, it has a unique table to ensure uniqueness of nodes
/// (typically, there should be no two nodes with the same children at the same
/// level). The manager supports some kind of garbage collection: If there are
/// no more edges pointing to a node, the node does not necessarily have to be
/// deleted immediately. It may well be that the node revives. But from time to
/// time it may make sense to remove all currently dead nodes. The manager also
/// supports a levelized view on the diagram (via [`LevelView`]s).
///
/// Note that we are way more concerned about levels than about variables here.
/// This is because variables can easily be handled externally. For many kinds
/// of diagrams, we can just use the function representation of a variable and
/// get the mapping between variables and levels "for free". This is especially
/// nice as there are reordering operations which change the mapping between
/// levels and variables but implicitly update the function representations
/// accordingly.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The implementation must ensure that every inner node only refers to nodes
/// stored in this manager.
///
/// Every level view is associated with a manager and a level number.
/// [`Manager::level()`] must always return the level view associated to this
/// manager with the given level number.
///
/// If [`Manager::InnerNode`] implements [`HasLevel`], then the implementation
/// must ensure that [`HasLevel::level()`] returns level number L for all nodes
/// at the level view for L. Specifically this means that
/// [`Manager::add_level()`] must check the newly created node. The invariant
/// may only be broken by unsafe code (e.g. via [`HasLevel::set_level()`] and
