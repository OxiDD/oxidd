## Use multi-threaded implementations of the apply algorithm
multi-threading = ["oxidd/multi-threading"]

## Use the index-based manager implementation
##
## This implementation is generally faster than the pointer-based
## implementation, but is more restricted: There is no possibility to reserve
## space for more nodes after the initial allocation and the total number of
## nodes is limited to 2³² nodes for BDDs/ZBDDs, or 2³¹ nodes for BCDDs.
manager-index = ["oxidd/manager-index"]

## Use the pointer-based manager implementation (suitable for BDDs/ZBDDs with
## more than 2³² nodes, or BCDDs with more than 2³¹ nodes)
##
## If both `manager-index` and `manager-pointer` are specified, the
## pointer-based implementation will be used.
manager-pointer = ["oxidd/manager-pointer"]

## Enable the direct mapped apply cache
apply-cache-direct-mapped = ["oxidd/apply-cache-direct-mapped"]
