default = []

## Check that `Edge` is never dropped via its `Drop` implementation. This is
## done by adding a function call to a non-existing external function to the
## `Drop` implementation. So if the check fails, there will be a weird linker
## error. Using this feature in unoptimized builds may cause false positives.
